# Stock Exchange Chatbot

### Tech Stack

I used the ReactJS. Next.js and TailwincCSS stack for my app.

### Assumptions

I assume the user should be able to access more than 5 stocks if the database allows it.

### Additional features

Additional to the requirements, the app features the following:
- Case handling in case user wants to pick another exchange
- Reusable components like Button, Navbar or Message
- Scalable code (the chat is based on a message array which can be used for possible future features like message editing or history)
- Scroll to bottom functionality for the chatbox

## Setting up the App

To set up the app, use your preferred package manager to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
 

## Running the App

To get the app running, simply use the following Next.js basic instructions:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev 
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
